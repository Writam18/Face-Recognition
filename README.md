Facial Recognition System using Dlib and Openface

A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database.

Face Detection is done using Dlib library.Dlib for face detection uses a combination of HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradient) & Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is trained on positive and negative images (meaning there are images that have faces and ones that donâ€™t).

After we isolate the image from the background and preprocess it using dlib we need to find a way to represent the face in numerical embedding. We can represent it using pretrained deep neural network OpenFace which produce 128 facial embeddings that represent a generic face.

After getting the embedding of each of the images in dataset , we can train a machine learning model or NN model as a classifier taking face embedding as train data and names as class label of train data.
